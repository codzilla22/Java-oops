Inheritance in oop:
                   Inheritance is a very important concept in java oops. In this concept you can create a parent and a child class with extend keyword. This means that 
the child class can inherit the data of the parent class but the parent class cannot inherit the data of the child class.


For example:
             Class A has an instance variable "a" and there is another class B with an instance variable "b". Now if we create an object for class B it can use its own variable "b" as well as the instance variable of class A i.e "a". But if we create an object for the class A and try to assign valur=e to the variable of class B i.e "b" 
it will give you an error because you cannot access the child class data with the object of the parent class.
